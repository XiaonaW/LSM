Light sheet microscopy with high spatial resolution based on polarized structured illumination beam modulated by the phase mask 
The detection.mat contains the data of 3D detection PSF.
The fig2a.mat~fig2e.mat contain the data of phase-modulated illumination PSF in x-z plane, when K is set to 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8.
The fig3a.m is the program to produce the fig3a in manuscript, which contains the Gaussian illumination PSF and phase-modulated illumination PSF in x-z plane.
The fig3b.m is the program to produce the fig3b in manuscript, which contains the illumination PSFs of Gaussian lightsheet and SIM lightsheet in x-z plane.
The fig3c.m is the program to produce the fig3c in manuscript, which contains the overall PSF of Gaussian lightsheet and SIM lightsheet in x-z plane.
The fig 7.m is the program to produce the fig7 in manuscript,which can produce the illumination PSFs of Gaussian beam and phased-modualted beam in the y-z plane.
The Gaussian_ill_3D.mat contains the 3D illumination PSF of Gaussian beam.The Gaussian_ill_xz.mat contains the illumination PSF of Gaussian beam in x-z plane.
The phasemodulated_ill_3D.mat contains the 3D illumination PSF of phase-modulated radially polarized beam.
The phasemodulated_ill_xz.mat contains the 3D illumination PSF of phase-modulated radially polarized beam in x-z plane.
